This Dash (Python) web application creates an economic indicator dashboard using data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API.

Key components and functionality:

1. **Data Source and Configuration**:
- Uses the FRED API to fetch economic indicators (like unemployment rate, GDP, etc.)
- Stores 5 years (60 months) of historical data
- Uses Replit's database (db) for data persistence

2. **Core Features**:
- **Heatmap Dashboard**: Shows economic indicators in a color-coded grid
  - Green: Positive change
  - Red: Negative change 
  - Grey: No significant change
- **Direction Classification**: Each indicator can be marked as "Positive is Good" or "Positive is Bad"
- **Composite Index**: Allows creating weighted averages of multiple indicators

3. **Main Components**:

```python
def classify_value(value, prev_value, direction_factor=1, up_threshold=0.01):
```
- Classifies month-to-month changes as positive/negative/neutral
- Takes into account whether increasing values are good or bad for each indicator

```python
def fetch_series_monthly(series_id):
```
- Fetches monthly data from FRED API
- Processes and formats the data for display

```python
def get_composite_df(weights_dict):
```
- Creates a weighted average of multiple indicators
- Allows users to customize the weights

4. **UI Features**:
- Interactive dashboard with clickable cells showing detailed charts
- Modal windows for expanded views
- Ability to add new indicators
- Manual refresh functionality
- Weight adjustment interface for the composite index

5. **Auto-Updates**:
- Background thread runs a scheduler
- Automatically refreshes all data weekly

6. **Navigation**:
- Two main pages:
  1. Dashboard (heatmap view)
  2. Composite Index page

This application would be useful for economists, analysts, or anyone interested in tracking multiple economic indicators simultaneously and creating custom composite indices from them.
